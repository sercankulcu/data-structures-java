Data Structures in Java
Welcome to the Data Structures in Java repository! This project provides clean and well-documented implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. It serves as a learning resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in understanding how data structures work under the hood.
Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures, each in its own source file. The code is designed to be simple, readable, and reusable, making it ideal for educational purposes or as a reference for building more complex applications.
Implemented Data Structures
The following data structures are included in this repository:

ArrayList: A dynamic array implementation with resizing capabilities.
LinkedList: A singly or doubly linked list with basic operations (add, remove, etc.).
Stack: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure with push and pop operations.
Queue: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A tree-based structure with efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree for optimized performance.
Hash Table: A key-value store with hashing for fast lookups.
Heap: A priority queue implementation (min-heap or max-heap).
Graph: Basic graph representation with adjacency list/matrix (if applicable).

Each data structure is implemented in a separate file under the src/ directory.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.
A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with a Java compiler.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/sercankulcu/data-structures-java.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd data-structures-java


Compile and run the desired Java file(s) using a Java compiler or IDE:javac src/<DataStructure>.java

Note: Most files contain standalone implementations without a main method. You can create a test class to use these data structures.

Usage
Each data structure is implemented as a Java class with methods for common operations (e.g., insert, delete, search). To use a data structure:

Import the desired class into your Java project.
Create an instance of the data structure and call its methods. For example:ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
list.add(42);
System.out.println(list.get(0)); // Outputs: 42



Refer to the source code in src/ for detailed method signatures and implementations.
